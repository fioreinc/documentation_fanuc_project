# Fanuc Project Documentation

A repository for storing documents and the wiki for the Fanuc robotic arm project at Fiore. This is commonly accessible place. We will also be able to track changes made to the documentation which will give insight to what the contributer was trying to do on the project at that time. 

The way Github works, this is basically an empty repository containing this simple README.md file. We will also use this repository to store images and documents needed in the wiki. 

You can access the wiki via the symbol on the right that looks like an open book or through [this link][Doc Wiki]
